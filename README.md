## Features


1. In this project, I implemented a clean and user-friendly display for a list of books. I added a search bar that allows users to search for specific books by title or author. Each book entry includes details such as the title, author, cover image, genre, and a unique ID.

2. To enhance the user experience, I implemented a dropdown filter that allows users to filter books based on their genre or topic. I also created a wishlist feature, where users can save their favorite books. The wishlist data is stored in localStorage, and wishlisted books are marked with a heart icon.

3. I implemented pagination to ensure that the book list is displayed efficiently, with 10 books shown per page. Additionally, I used AOS for smooth animations, creating a more engaging interface.

4. To improve the user experience, I used localStorage to save the user's search and filter preferences, ensuring that their settings persist even after the page is refreshed. This project allowed me to combine several features to create an intuitive and interactive book browsing experience.
